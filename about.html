    <h2 class="text-white">Passion for software engineering</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>My name is Nicholas Samaras, I am 38 years old and currently I am a student software developer learning 
          how to code websites and software from the ground up. Over the last 20 years I have acquired knowledge 
      not only of computer skils , I have personaly taken my life to heights that not many people would ever dare.
      Over time I am excited to see where my new skills are going to excel. Nothing works better than having a strong 
      team of people to work with.  Being a team player and working well with other people and developers is going to be the 
       skill that keeps me moving me forward.</p>

        <p><strong>The services I can provide are communication, teamwork, test driven development, and inteplentation of applications.

      <div class="container3">
        <p><strong>Outside of software development I have spent time in school for music production as that has been a 
          deepley loved hobby of mine for well over 15 years.  Music production software and all of its complexity
          has been the main reason why I found my way into software development.  Hopefully soon I will be able to 
          combine the two and code some new intelligent music software.</strong></p>
